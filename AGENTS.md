# X Scroll To Top Responsive

- This repository preserves the WordPress.org 3.1.2 baseline. Existing Git history must be retained.
- Keep the WordPress.org slug `x-scroll-to-top-responsive` and main file `plugin-hook.php` unchanged.
- Install Node 24 dependencies with `npm ci` and PHP tools with `composer install`.
- Run `composer lint:syntax`, `composer lint`, `npm run test:php`, and `npm run test:e2e` as appropriate.
- Seed the persistent Docker demo with `npm run demo:seed`; default port 8890. Browser tests reset only `.wp-env.e2e*.json` profiles. Read `docs/demo.md` before changing environment mappings.
- Keep premium themes/plugins in ignored `.local/` paths. Never commit credentials, customer data, or local overrides.
- Existing coding findings have a baseline. Do not increase it to hide new findings; explain intentional baseline changes.
- Do not claim compatibility with dependency versions that have not been tested.
- WordPress.org publishing runs only when a stable GitHub release is published. Preparing or merging changes must not publish. Never create/publish a release or run the publisher without explicit user authorization; the preview is read-only.
- Build release ZIPs with `npm run build`. A future release must have a new version and matching metadata before deployment.
